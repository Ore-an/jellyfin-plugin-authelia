A plugin for Jellyfin that allows using [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) as an authentication and authorization backend.

## ü§î Description

Unlike [SSO plugin](https://github.com/nikarh/jellyfin-plugin-authelia), this plugin uses [Authelia HTTP API](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/blob/master/api/openapi.yml).
The benefit of that approach is a native Jellyfin form and API for authentication. This means that any existing Jellyfin client should work with this plugin/
The drawback of this approach though is that only username+password authentication is supported (no 2FA).

The plugin will automatically create a new Jellyfin user upon successful authentication. Any valid Authelia user can login to Jellyfin.

## üèóÔ∏è Usage

1. Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikarh/jellyfin-plugin-authelia/main/manifest.json` as a new Jellyfin plugin repository
2. Install `Authelia Authentication` plugin from catalog
3. Configure the plugin by entering the URL of your Authelia server (can be either private or public), and a URL of your Jellyfin installation used in Authelia `configuration.yml` rule.
